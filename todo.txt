Think about remove virtualServer block that have wrong addresses? 


Challenge

handle non 200 status if host is not found (bad request): how to chose a virtual server?

Note

I realize localhost:8080/folder and this localhost:8080/folder/ are not the same. The slash is used at the end to know if it's a folder or not
